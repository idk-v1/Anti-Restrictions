# Anti-Restrictions
#### Programs and settings to get around as many restrictions as possible.
##### Use only for Columbia Public Schools.
### For wallpaper change
##### Drag and drop a .jpg file onto wall.bat or replace it manually and open wall.bat to refresh
#### WARNING! YOU WILL LOSE THE CURRENT WALLPAPER FILE AND ALL ACTIVE EXPLORER WINDOWS

##### admin.bat will enable installers that need admin permissions to open, but cannot edit program files, or if the installer requests admin permissions instead of windows this will not work.

### For unblocked internet access
##### Download [Waterfox](https://github.com/WaterfoxCo/Waterfox/releases/download/G4.1.2/Install.Waterfox.exe)
##### Replace 
```C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Waterfox\Profiles\5w22ey3h.default-default\prefs.js```
##### with this modified prefs.js
##### Or reinstall some kind of firefox. Make sure to change the proxy setting to automatic or manual if able.

#### Ever feel like website backgrounds are restrictive. /s
##### Type code below into the dev tools console. 
#### Amogus everywhere!*
